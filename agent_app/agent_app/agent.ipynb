Background\\n\\n1.1.1.1. Imperatives for a National AI Strategy\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nThe advent of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) has precipitated a paradigmatic shift in global innovation and transformation, driving cutting-edge advancements across nations and industries. The ramiﬁcations of its impact on the global ecosystem and speciﬁcally on the developmental trajectory of Nigeria and other African nations are profound and far-reaching. Nigeria, as the continent\\'s most populous country, is singularly positioned to harness AI\\'s transformative capacity to address pressing socio-economic conundrums, accelerate economic growth, and pivot the nation into a new epoch of technological empowerment, which unlocks unprecedented opportunities for sustainable development, economic prosperity, and human ﬂourishing.\\n\\nIn recent years, Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has emerged globally as the driving force behind the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a transformative technological phenomenon with far-reaching implications for governments, citizens, and industries. While AI will catalyse new possibilities and open new opportunities for economic development, it poses unprecedented challenges for governments, especially on issues of ethical applications, algorithmic transparency, data privacy and potential labour market displacements. It is, therefore, imperative for the government, as the guardian of public welfare and provider of collective goods and services, to bear a unique responsibility in ensuring that AI yields inclusive beneﬁts for the broader population rather than exacerbating existing inequalities. The process of leading the cultivation of AI-driven economies for the beneﬁt of all citizens must be consultative and participatory to ensure that all societal sectors are engaged in strategic deliberation, given its pervasive applications and direct impact on everyone.\\n\\nThe year 2024 has been described as a watershed year for the advancement of AI, as government, academia, and industry stakeholders endeavour to determine the most effective and pragmatic strategies for integrating this transformative technological innovation into our daily lives, thereby harnessing its vast potential to drive meaningful impact and improvement at scale. This builds on the growing investment in AI by the public and private sectors in the last few years. Global corporate investment in AI has increased signiﬁcantly in the last ﬁve years (1). Research by Deutsche Bank showed that the total global corporate investment in AI has grown 150% since 2019 to nearly $180 billion (N240 trillion naira), while the number of public AI projects rose to almost 350,000 by the end of 2022 (2). More speciﬁcally, the Nigerian AI market is poised for substantial growth, with a projected $434.4 million by 2026, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44.2%. This remarkable expansion underscores the escalating adoption of AI solutions across diverse sectors, including ﬁnance, agriculture, healthcare, and telecommunications, driven by technological advancements and innovative applications.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nDeveloping a national AI plan is a signiﬁcant, strategic undertaking that spans the entire value chain, including socio-economic levers. For this reason, it is critical to shape a national AI ecosystem that aligns with a country’s strategic priorities, strengths, and weaknesses and with core advantages and assets that can be leveraged at the national and international levels. It is also essential that any nation’s foundational challenges be considered when developing an overarching plan. For example, while Nigeria possesses promising opportunities resulting from rapid population growth, a large potential labour force, and a high youth population, other challenges such as illiteracy levels, limited broadband penetration, and constrained physical infrastructure are mitigating factors. Additionally, the strategy must therefore highlight the inherent considerations that must be carefully addressed in developing and deploying local AI solutions in Nigeria, especially as it relates to improving the public education system, deepening adequate data ecosystem, and driving public ownership for shared prosperity of all. These issues and more are why a holistic national AI strategy is imperative, coupled with accountable indicators, measurable objectives, and investment targets (1).\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nThe Nigerian government has demonstrated the need for an inclusive, public-centred, and well-articulated roadmap to harness the beneﬁts of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) for the public good while mitigating the risks of AI’s diverse possibilities. This national position is anchored on the enormous importance of AI as a nation-deﬁning capability; hence, the need for a bottom-up approach that integrates a diversity of thought, embeds inclusiveness of expertise, and supports human-centred application of AI across all user groups and expert value chains. It is against this backdrop that Nigeria’s Ministry of Communications, Innovation and Digital Economy hosted a 4-day workshop themed “Developing the High-level Strategy and Implementation Plan for a National AI Strategy for Nigeria” between April 15 and 18, 2024, to co-create a National Artiﬁcial Intelligence Strategy (NAIS), led by the physical attendance of the Honourable Minister of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy, Dr Bosun Tijani.\\n\\nThe workshop ran as a knowledge synthesis and ideation workshop, bringing together global and local experts in Artiﬁcial Intelligence. The session attested to the immense importance that the Nigerian government places on the active involvement and participation of multiple stakeholders in developing a holistic strategy that aligns the country’s strategic priorities, leverageable competitive advantage, strategic assets, strengths, and weaknesses as a foundational baseline for a differentiated and bespoke AI strategy that is designed for all its citizens. The sessions ran as plenary and multiple parallel break-out sessions where experts jointly explored global best practices, analysed the Nigerian context, and deﬁned the unique Nigerian-centric AI strategy pathway. The sessions articulated the national AI vision, measurable impact goals, implementation roadmap, governance structures, and necessary steps to catalyse Nigeria into an AI-driven economy with a clear line of sight on critical dependencies.\\n\\nThis inaugural National Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) Strategy, a landmark initiative aimed at harnessing the transformative potential of AI to drive sustainable development, innovation, national productivity, and human well-being, will solidify Nigeria\\'s position as a champion in AI adoption on the African continent, building on the nation’s pioneering establishment of the National Centre for AI and Robotics (NCAIR) and many AI-speciﬁc government initiatives to foster a knowledge-based economy and promote research and development in AI systems.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR ATEGY 2 024\\n\\nThis position reinforces the importance of AI as a means to differential advantage in the global ecosystem of fragmented yet intrinsically linked global supply chains of AI knowledge and innovations. It is a strategic bridge that will address most infrastructural constraints in emerging markets and provides a leapfrog for nuanced innovations.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n1.1.1.2. Rationale for a National AI Strategy\\n\\nThe national AI strategy serves as a comprehensive roadmap and guiding framework for harnessing the rapidly evolving technological landscape and socio-economic trends, enabling a nation to chart its distinctive course and develop a tailored approach to optimise the beneﬁts of AI for the betterment of society (1). A proactive approach in the formulation of national AI strategy enables nations to enhance the welfare and quality of life of their citizens, primarily through an intentional application of AI to drive meaningful improvements in critical sectors such as healthcare, education, and agriculture, ultimately leading to better outcomes, increased efficiency, and improved citizen experience.\\n\\nAI’s impact on achieving the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been noted (3).SDGs were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030, all people will enjoy peace and prosperity. Research posits that AI can contribute to nearly 80 percent of the SDGs and their targets. Another study, using a consensus-based expert elicitation process, found that AI may enable the accomplishment of 134 targets across all 17 SDG goals. The implication of this is evidenced in the UN estimates that achieving the SDGs in Africa could open $12 trillion in market opportunities and 380 million jobs by 2030 (4)(5). AI innovations with the potential to positively impact the SDGs are already happening in Nigeria. For example, in the agriculture sector, which inﬂuences SDG Goal 2, zero hunger, local AI startups have shown great promise with AI-powered precision agriculture solutions that provide data-driven insights to help farmers optimise their outputs. Similarly, startups in renewable energy are inﬂuencing SDG Goal 7, affordable and green energy, by demonstrating how AI can be applied to manage solar energy needs and consumption patterns, understand household credit risk, and estimate demand for energy solutions (3). These productivity improvements have a direct impact on economic contribution. AI innovations have the potential to contribute to economic growth in Africa. The African Union Development Agency estimates that AI could double Africa’s Gross Domestic Growth (GDP) growth rate by 2035 (6).\\n\\nWhat makes AI a compelling force for advancement and change is that the technology has the potential to make an impact for all, irrespective of a nation’s developmental cycle. It can provide a veritable alternative to address less developed countries’ human resource and infrastructure gaps as it can be adapted to serve nuanced development-oriented use cases (5). Attaining signiﬁcant results such as these, where AI bridges developmental gaps, requires a strategic approach that includes accelerating development and solidifying governmental commitment to a shared vision, long-term orientation, responsible governance frameworks, and values that build trust and cohesion. The upside is the potential for game-changing improvements in core areas that underscore a nation’s health and\\n\\n9.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nlongevity: health, education, food security, energy, and climate action. While there are concerns, among others, that the developing world could be left behind as AI advances rapidly, it is an emerging knowledge that if AI is deployed effectively and harnessed responsibly, it promises to drive inclusive and sustainable growth–reducing poverty and inequality, advancing environmental sustainability, improving lives, and empowering individuals in all societies across all stages of development (7).\\n\\nAI is, therefore, a developmental equaliser at a scale similar to the internet. It will also be the great differentiator, and the nations that become the leaders in its application will rule the emerging world (8). In an increasingly AI-driven world, countries with a compelling national AI strategy will soar above others, leading to a perhaps impenetrable hierarchy that will beneﬁt some while leaving others behind. This is the AI reality and imperative that each nation faces today, as validated by its potential contribution to global and local economies. PwC estimates the potential contribution of AI to the global economy will be $15.7 trillion by 2030—more than the current output of China and India combined—with a boost of up to 26% in GDP for local economies over the same period (9). Labour productivity improvements will drive initial GDP gains; however, strategic investment in AI technology will be needed to realise the global economy’s full productivity and GDP potential. PwC expects developing countries to experience more modest increases due to AI technologies’ much lower adoption rates. However, what is intriguing from PwC’s analysis is just how big a game-changer AI is likely to be and how much value potential is up for grabs, creating swaths of opportunity for an articulated national strategy (9). Like PwC’s ﬁndings, McKinsey estimates that AI will contribute $13 trillion by 2030 or about 16 percent higher cumulative GDP than today. This amounts to 1.2 percent additional GDP growth per year, with developing countries having a great opportunity to capture as much as 15 percent (10).\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nAI is becoming the basis for national competitiveness. Nations with better and more inclusive strategies to drive automation, innovations, and broad-based mass education on AI, complemented with the right levels of investment, will leverage it to win (11). However, while AI presents vast opportunities, its execution requires several trade-offs driven by societal values and the outcomes that each nation wants (12). Therefore, the far-reaching scope of its impact suggests a collaborative and inclusive approach to national strategy development, which has also been proven effective. For example, the work of the Future Society in its support for the development of 3 National AI Strategies between 2020 and 2022 validates the imperatives of holistic stakeholder inclusion. The Future Society’s approach included robust stakeholder consultations, facilitating expert exploration sessions, developing governance documents, frameworks, policies, and implementation plans, and creating SWOT analyses of local AI ecosystems, ethical guidelines, and implementation recommendations (13).\\n\\nIn setting a national AI strategy, learnings from other nations, including developing nations, show that AI must be anchored on a compelling national vision aligned with national developmental priorities. This is consistent with the position in Google’s “AI Sprinters,” a new report that provides a roadmap for developing countries to take advantage of AI’s potential. The report outlines four recommendations to hasten the positive impacts of AI: (1) revolutionise infrastructure with 100% adoption of cloud-ﬁrst policies, (2) support people with national AI skill initiatives, (3) modernise national data systems, and (4) support AI-enabling regulation. The report emphasises that four considerations will help every nation prioritise its development strategies and thus guide the Nigerian AI strategy (14).\\n\\n10\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n1.1.2. AI for Socio-Economic Growth\\n\\nNigeria and the broader African continent possess some of the most distinctive and compelling challenges and opportunities that AI could address. From optimising agriculture in diverse climates to improving public health infrastructure, locally developed AI solutions, adapted to local realities, are far better equipped to solve these challenges than externally imposed models created for an entirely different context and people. Therefore, developing a homegrown AI strategy that provides Nigeria with a clear roadmap for AI application will catalyse relevant innovation and aid in rebalancing power structures. This presents a massive opportunity for Nigeria to play as the leader of AI in Africa. This can be likened to how the mobile phone revolution (GSM) swept sub-Saharan Africa in the late 2000s and facilitated access to services with a tangible economic multiplier effect (15).\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nAI must beneﬁt humanity. This requires a prudent balance of policies to tap AI’s potential while reducing its risks. To achieve this end, nations must articulate a thoughtful, comprehensive blueprint addressing how they will seek to harness the beneﬁts of AI for the public good while mitigating its impact on jobs, livelihoods, and other potential harms. This is particularly critical to ensure that low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are included, given the rapid pace at which AI accelerates. Local communities must be allowed to provide their perspective and cultural context into AI so they can decide on both (1) their thresholds for safe usage and 2) the overall utility of AI within their own lives. Additionally, LMICs must have access to AI tools and approaches to facilitate responsible, global use of AI (16).\\n\\nAI’s potential can be unleashed to catalyse positive social change, ensuring sustainable and equitable progress for communities worldwide. Yet the realisation of social beneﬁts is not without a signiﬁcant, coordinated work effort at different levels of impact for the developed and underdeveloped countries. A study published by the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship in partnership with the World Economic found that three actions, taken collectively, are imperative to untethering AI: (1) prioritising inclusive and responsible AI practices, (2) fostering cross-sector collaborations, and (3) addressing the existing, country-speciﬁc challenges. This is consistent with the IMF assessment of the AI readiness of 125 countries utilising a custom indicator called the AI Preparedness Index that measures readiness on multiple variables, including digital infrastructure, human capital and labour-market policies, innovation and economic integration, and regulation and ethics (17). Not surprisingly, the ﬁndings revealed an advanced economy advantage—i.e., wealthier economies demonstrated superior positioning for AI adoption relative to low-income countries. This further rationalises why emerging markets like Nigeria must intentionally devise their unique nation-speciﬁc beneﬁcial strategies by focusing on IMF’s two critical enablers: (1) laying a strong foundation through investments in digital infrastructure and (2) developing a digitally competent workforce (17).\\n\\nAs a general-purpose technology, AI must be made to serve low-income countries like Nigeria by delivering meaningful changes within and across economies, including a sizeable boost to productivity derived from one-off efficiency savings, multi-factor productivity such as facilitating better working practices, and aiding innovation—though this beneﬁt is more uncertain than the others (15). However, potential gains are one thing, and realised gains are quite another. AI will most likely deliver a signiﬁcant boost to productivity if several factors come together, including a rise in investment, reskilling of the\\n\\n11.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nworkforce, and a balanced regulatory regime (15). Achieving compelling productivity gains at the national level will hinge on whether countries have the essential factors to help them utilise AI effectively, a challenge addressed through a holistic national AI strategy.\\n\\nA national AI strategy, therefore, must provide nuanced guiding principles clearly deﬁned and articulated in alignment with country values and goals, as well as ensure consistency with higher-order goals for the future of humanity and civilisation. It must provide a foundational baseline to catalyse homegrown innovations through intentional local capacity building and ecosystem enablement. It must also clarify the right incentive to overcome the hurdles to AI in local markets while emphasising shared societal beneﬁts. It must attract high-impact strategic investment to drive breakthroughs, support national productivity and accelerate the creation and delivery of new or enhanced value for the good of all.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n1.1.3. AI in Nigeria\\n\\n1.1.3.1. Introduction\\n\\nNigeria’s commitment to AI is evident in the various initiatives championed by the Ministry of Communication, Innovation and Digital Economy (FMICDE) in the last few years. The ministry has a dedicated National Centre for Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Robotics (NCAIR), set up as a digital innovation and research facility focused on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Robotics and Drones, Internet of Things (IoT), and other emerging technologies, aimed at transforming the Nigerian digital economy, in line with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS). NCAIR also focuses on creating a thriving ecosystem for innovation-driven entrepreneurship (IDE), job creation and national development. Before establishing NCAIR, Nigeria’s Digital Economy Policy and Strategy 2020 – 2030 (NDEPS) listed AI as one of eight strategic pillars. In addition, the ongoing nationwide talent development, 3MTT, aimed to train three million digital talents, is justiﬁably positioning Nigeria as a global hub for the application of AI. The recent effort of the Ministry to drive home-grown research through the provision of research grants to forty-ﬁve AI startups and researchers through the Nigeria Artiﬁcial Intelligence Research Scheme (NAIRS) in critical sectors of the countries is evidence of emerging Nigeria’s talent and entrepreneurial ecosystem. Additionally, the boundaries of Nigeria’s AI efforts extend beyond domestic lines. In 2023, Nigeria signed the Bletchley Declaration on AI, along with 28 other nations, including the UK and France, committing to AI development that mitigates risk. Similarly, Nigeria joined 18 different countries that adopted the US-led coalition to ensure AI is secure by design (18).\\n\\nWith a solid platform to build upon, the Ministry, under the leadership of Dr. Bosun Tijani, released a white paper in 2023 announcing steps to engage top AI researchers of Nigerian descent globally to craft a comprehensive National AI Strategy. In 2024, Nigeria enacted updated data protection legislation. While the 2023 Data Protection Act does not particularly address AI-related data concepts, it does outline crucial issues like data security and cross-border data transfer – both essential pillars for developing AI models (18). The outcome of these efforts within the fast-growing Nigeria’s local AI innovators has not gone unnoticed internationally. For example, 4 Nigerian innovators won the Gates Foundation Grand Challenge focused on developing global health and development solutions using\\n\\n12.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nAI-enabled large language models (LLMs) (19). Similarly, over 10 Nigerian products have been listed in the UNESCO IRCAI Global Top 100, a list of the top 100 projects solving problems related to the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (20). The country’s inventive AI researchers ecosystem has also been recognised with high-proﬁle funding, including the Artiﬁcial Intelligence for Development Africa specially funded EduAI Hub, an African-based research network on responsible artiﬁcial intelligence innovations that seek to advance education across Africa and managed by the University of Lagos and Data Science Nigeria (DSN), under the special US $20 million intervention program funded by the Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and Sweden’s government agency for development cooperation (Sida) to promote excellence in solving development challenges through responsible and inclusive AI (21).\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n1.1.3.2. Ecosystem Mapping\\n\\nThe Nigerian AI ecosystem exempliﬁes a complex technological ecosystem wherein diverse entities engage in symbiotic relationships to facilitate value creation and delivery, beneﬁting all stakeholders. The ecosystem mapping presented in this segment provides a systematic and comprehensive representation of the various players and roles contributing to the ecosystem’s functioning, including the mainstream, enabler, and adjacent players. This underscores the signiﬁcance of a systems or network approach in understanding how AI ecosystems generate value, a crucial consideration in developing an inclusive strategy that supports all entities within the value chain. This systemic thinking and the interconnectedness among stakeholders, including actors, organisations, and other factors inﬂuencing the AI community, facilitate intentional collaboration and mutually beneﬁcial value creation. Furthermore, recognising the multifaceted interactions between disparate groups enables a nuanced understanding of the ecosystem\\'s dynamics, fostering effective collaboration and strategic decision-making.

Opportunities and Beneﬁts\\n\\nNigeria, Africa’s largest economy, stands at a massive opportunity in leveraging AI for high-impact transformation. On the one hand, its youthful population and growing tech scene present fertile ground for the development and adoption of AI. On the other hand, infrastructure limitations and a nascent AI ecosystem pose signiﬁcant challenges. This SWOT analysis attempts to proﬁle key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that can inform the development of a holistic AI strategy for Nigeria.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nFormulating effective strategies for fostering a thriving AI ecosystem in Nigeria necessitates a critical and introspective approach. Understanding the interplay between internal strengths, like a youthful population and budding technology sector, and external factors, such as global trends and market demands, is paramount. By identifying these elements, policymakers, investors, and entrepreneurs can leverage Nigeria\\'s unique potential in the international AI landscape. Recognising internal weaknesses, such as infrastructure deﬁciencies and lacking skilled personnel, allows for targeted interventions to bridge these gaps. Capitalising on emerging opportunities presented by the AI revolution can unlock signiﬁcant economic growth and societal beneﬁts for Nigeria. However, a critical lens is also crucial to mitigate potential threats associated with AI development, safeguarding the nation\\'s future and ensuring it reaps the rewards of responsible technological advancement.\\n\\n1.1.3.3.1.

NAIS in Context with Other Strategies\\n\\nThis National AI strategy is premised on existing policies and regulations, including:\\n\\nThe conceptualisation of this National AI strategy was part of the blueprint, “Accelerating our Collective Prosperity through Technical Efficiency: A Strategic Plan for the Federal Ministry of Communications, Innovation and Digital Economy”, recognised AI as an emerging technology for knowledge development as well as the need of this National AI Strategy to improve our global readiness and adoption of AI. In addition, the blueprint advocates other policies, such as the Nigeria Data Policy, to review and implement Nigeria’s Open Data Policy.\\n\\nAI’s dependence on data makes the National Data Protection (NDP) Act 2023 statutes protect data subjects and guide the processing of personal data essential. Speciﬁcally, the intersectionality of the NDPA includes:\\n\\n\\n\\nResponsible data collection: Adherence to the data minimisation and purpose limitation principles ensures AI solutions collect only the right amount of data for the intended purposes.\\n\\n15.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n\\n\\nIndividual rights: Align AI principles with personal rights and rectify or erase their data as outlined in the NDPA.\\n\\nData security: protecting sensitive data used in AI systems •\\n\\nTransparency and trust: Complying with NDPA transparency requirements and building public conﬁdence in AI development and data use\\n\\nAttaining the goals of the National Broadband Plan to deliver data speeds of 25Mbps in urban areas and 10Mbps in rural areas is critical to promoting AI adoption and development. Improved broadband infrastructure enables data ﬂows, boosts digital literacy, supports cloud computing and innovation, and empowers participation.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nOnline safety and security of citizens are part of the purview of Cybercrimes (Prohibition and Prevention, etc.) Act 2015 (amendment Act 2024) addresses cyber threats and online safety. Cybersecurity is required within the AI strategy, incorporating cybersecurity measures speciﬁc to AI systems, mitigating potential vulnerabilities, and ensuring the security of AI-powered applications.\\n\\nIn its ﬁrst iteration, NITDA’s Strategic Roadmap and Action Plan (SRAP) established the National Centre for Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Robotics (NCAIR) to advance AI research and development. The second version, aligning with the Ministry’s strategic plan, highlights AI as one of the focus emerging technologies and the need for industry-academia collaboration and technology centres of excellence.\\n\\nApplying Nigeria’s intellectual property laws - the Copyright Act, Chapter C28 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004; the Trademarks Act, Chapter T13 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004; the Patents and Designs Act, and Chapter P2 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 - to inventions and creative works like algorithms and AI models are critical to promoting innovation and protecting the intellectual property rights of developers.\\n\\nAI algorithms and data use impact competition within various sectors, fostering a fair and competitive AI landscape. The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission Act 2020 protects against unfair competition.\\n\\nThe National Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Policy promotes research and development. Aligning this AI strategy with this policy can leverage existing STI initiatives and funding mechanisms to support AI research and development.\\n\\n16.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n1.1.3.5.1. Box: Broadband Connectivity\\n\\nLimited Internet Access and Bandwidth Slows Innovation: Nigeria\\'s internet speeds are considerably slower than developed nations. According to the Speedtest Global Index (22), Nigeria\\'s average download speed is around 35 Mbps, signiﬁcantly lower than the global average of 93 Mbps (as of April 2024), placing Nigeria at a worldwide rank of 111th and 140th on mobile and ﬁxed broadband, respectively. According to the Portulans Institute’s Network Readiness Index (23), Nigeria scored 35.73, ranking 106 out of 134 economies.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n1.1.4. Global Trends and Benchmarks\\n\\n1.1.4.1. Global AI Strategy Developments\\n\\nEvery nation must develop its unique and compelling AI strategy that centres on its unique assets and opportunities while mitigating shortcomings and risks. With the plethora of national AI strategies today—and the growing number of studies and reports assessing those strategies nationally and globally—embarking on the journey to develop a national plan must be very intentional, especially for developing nations where the transformational impact is even more imperative.\\n\\nThe World Economy Forum provided a standard methodology and relevant template for developing a “minimum viable” AI strategy for a nation (24). This methodology entails a comprehensive assessment of a country\\'s strategic priorities, strengths, and weaknesses, focusing on aligning the deployment of limited resources with the nation\\'s demographic needs, strategic priorities, citizen aspirations, resource constraints, and geopolitical considerations. This framework ensures a nuanced and contextualised approach to AI strategy development, acknowledging the complex interplay of factors that shape a nation\\'s AI trajectory.\\n\\nSimilarly, Boston Consulting Group provided a blueprint, ASPIRE, as a valuable tool for carving a path to AI national strategy development leadership. The premise of the BCG model to frame national AI strategy is about how each nation must ﬁnd its speciﬁc and competitive foothold in this fast-evolving digital landscape, anchored on six foundational elements: 1. Ambition, 2. Skills, 3. Policy and Regulation, 4. Investment, 5. Research/innovation, and 6. Ecosystem (25). At the heart of the AI strategy is the need for nations to have a compelling national ambition, which will guide what is possible, determine overall objectives, and direct the allocation of resources. Based on about 50 existing national AI strategies reviewed by BCG, the document identiﬁed three central archetypes of how nations can articulate their AI national ambition that is (1) national enabler (AI ambition to create and nurture local champions,\\n\\n17.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR ATEGY 2 024\\n\\nimprove their socio-economic condition, enhance quality of life, and pursue other national objectives primarily by encouraging responsible AI and reskilling their workforce); (2) Specialist (AI ambition aimed to develop speciﬁc expertise that can be promoted globally); and (3) Industry Leader (AI ambition archetype that focusses on being global leaders in a broad set of AI capabilities from R&D to implementation) (25).\\n\\nAccording to the work by BCG, most countries ﬁt into one of the three archetypes, although strategic details and progress along their chosen AI paths vary substantially. As a strategic framework, the BCG model is an exceptional starting point for countries looking to initiate national AI strategy development, primarily when used with the World Economic Forum guidelines, as both provide actionable templates for ambition-driven and context-realistic strategy development. Therefore, Nigeria must have a higher-order strategy that clariﬁes our national strategic intent, expressed through goals and objectives. With the boundless complexity of AI policy and strategy development, using these frameworks and tools as guidelines helps to narrow the strategic landscape in crafting and launching a robust AI strategy that unites a nation and leads to successful outcomes.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nAdditionally, AI strategy must progress from abstract ideas to practical processes with an intentional focus on its ethical development and implementation of AI, as provided for in UNESCO\\'s Recommendation on the Ethics of AI (26). AI strategy, accompanied by ethical imperatives, must allow for a robust embedding of principles and values through institutional and regulatory provisions (27). As represented by UNESCO’s RAM (Readiness Assessment Methodology), this approach provides a macro-level template that helps countries understand where they stand on the preparedness scale to adopt, apply, and safeguard AI deployment. The science of evaluating AI preparedness at a national level paves the way for the ethical imperative to be put into practice and with full consideration in the strategy design phase (28). For a high-impact national AI strategy, UNESCO’s RAM approach speciﬁes the need for a rigorous qualitative and quantitative evaluation that will include an all-encompassing ecosystem mapping to reveal ethical strengths and opportunities and speciﬁc areas that require development and improvement (29).\\n\\n18.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n1.1.4.2. Lessons from National AI Strategies\\n\\nWith the race to AI in full swing, the number of nations with AI strategies is proliferating, and so are the number of studies and reports analysing these strategies at a micro, nation-speciﬁc level and, separately, at a macro, global landscape level, as reﬂected upon in the previous section. At this nascent stage of AI, it is clear that nations are developing distinctive, compelling AI strategies in the same spirit and manner enterprises develop unique, compelling competitive strategies – i.e., to yield sustainable advantage. In the race to become a leader (or even a relevant player) in AI, no national strategy today is alike, each focusing on different aspects of AI policy. This fact is no more apparent than in the body of work released by HolonIQ, a global data platform. Holon’s 2020 AI Strategy Landscape Report provides a granular analysis of the AI strategies of ﬁfty nations (30).\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nOther approaches stand out as well. For example, unlike other national strategies, which focus on research and development or private sector uptake, Italy’s early emphasis has been on how the government can facilitate the adoption of AI technologies in public administration. Japan’s strategy is notable for its Industrialization Roadmap, which envisions AI as a service and organises the development of AI into three phases: (1) application in targeted domains, (2) the public use of AI, and (3) the creation of ecosystems connecting domains. Ten nations agreed to collaborate in the Nordic-Baltic region to “develop and promote the use of artiﬁcial intelligence to serve humans.” They speciﬁed that they would collaborate on (1) skills development, (2) access to data, (3) ethics and transparency, (4) hardware and software standards, (5) EU prominence, (6) avoiding unnecessary regulations, and (7) policy cooperation (31).\\n\\n1.1.4.2.1.\\n\\nFigure 4: AI strategy development (Source: Compiled by authors with data from Brookings Institute)\\n\\n19.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n1.1.4.3. Nigeria vs. Nations\\n\\nGovernments must play a vital role in AI by creating an enabling environment for the private sector and civil societies to build and deliver value that beneﬁts citizens. Various metrics, rankings, benchmarks, and comparative indicators have been employed to assess national preparedness for AI adoption, utilisation, and implementation. While these frameworks have limitations in capturing the nuanced context of national AI evolution, they provide valuable insights into strategic considerations crucial for developing a forward-looking AI strategy. Moreover, they facilitate cross-national learning, enabling countries to adopt best practices suited to their unique contexts. A comprehensive review of some of the most popular comparative indicators and rankings reveals that Nigeria lags, including among less developed African countries, in key areas such as infrastructure, investment, and implementation. However, despite development challenges, Nigeria is recognised as a burgeoning AI powerhouse, alongside Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa, due to its demonstrated potential for short-to-medium term investment in supercomputing capabilities, talent development, and anticipated growth in cloud and data centre (32). For instance, the 2023 edition of the global Oxford Insight AI Readiness Index, which measures how effectively AI is being adopted for the public good, ranks Nigeria 103 out of 193 countries (33). Despite Nigeria’s efforts in data policy and regulations, the report shows a sizeable gap in the “Data and Infrastructure Pillar”, which is vital for sustainable ecosystem development.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nSimilarly, the country ranks 61 out of 62 in the Global AI Index, a benchmark of nations based on their level of investment, innovation, and implementation of artiﬁcial intelligence (34). Viewed more granularly, the ﬁndings indicate that Nigeria under-indexes dimensions such as operating environment, infrastructure, and development—core starters for national capability development and innovation.\\n\\nIn addition, Nigeria’s lack of an enablement platform in the form of computer power has been identiﬁed in the Tony Blair Institute Report on National Compute Power. Speciﬁcally, the Institute categorised Nigeria as a “Rising Giant,” a level-3 player on a 7-level scale (35). A more integrated framework, the Top Ranked AI Nations (TRAIN) Index, reported in the December 2023 edition of Harvard Business Review, maps the emerging geography of AI leadership based on the work by The Fletcher School at Tufts University, USA (32). To compare the state of AI across twenty-ﬁve leading AI-creator countries, the researchers considered four broad variables, data, capital, rules, and innovation, that, when combined, formed the new measure called the TRAIN index. The model offers both a look into actual and anticipated competitive strategies (e.g., as some countries tighten AI regulation to attract those that prefer safety, others might lure companies that prefer openness by promising unfettered “pro-innovation” environments) while also providing a competitive snapshot of the global leader’s strategies for other, non-leading nations to isolate potential gaps and opportunities for competitive differentiation. This is where the TRAIN model delivers its greatest potency: as a global benchmark and general rubric for assessing the global AI competitive landscape over time to assist in developing or reﬁning country-speciﬁc or regional AI strategy for differential advantage. Nigeria currently ranks No 25 in the 25-country evaluation framework (36).\\n\\n20.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nBrookings Institute also published an in-depth analysis of the AI strategies of thirty-four nations, providing both benchmarking and insight into unique positioning opportunities in the global AI terrain. This is consistent with the Top Ranked AI Nations (TRAIN) Index and demonstrates a high-level global AI landscape segmentation map (much like a competitive positioning map) (37). The work evaluated various national AI strategies against six criteria —data management, algorithmic management, AI governance, research and development (R&D), capacity development, education capacity development, and public service reform capacity development—to provide insight into how individual countries approach AI deployment. The research demonstrated similarities and differences among nations based on each nation’s WEIRD-ness—i.e., how Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic they are. The WEIRD framework describes a set of countries with a particular psychology, motivation, and behaviour that can be differentiated from other countries (37). By analysing country strategies via a dual lens of the six elements and WEIRD attributes, the researchers could segment the thirty-four nations in review into ten groups—each with similar AI strategies and, importantly, similar drivers underscoring that strategy. Additionally, the framework yielded apparent differences between the strategic priorities of Western and non-Western nations.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n1.1.4.4. Variations in National AI Strategy: Developed vs. Developing Countries\\n\\nA study published in AI & Society also found that national AI strategies differ between developed and developing countries, albeit in scientiﬁc research, education, talent development, and ethics (38). Not surprisingly, the ﬁndings revealed signiﬁcant advantages to developed countries with advanced economies and solid technological infrastructures. Researchers noted, “These countries prioritise the development of ethical AI frameworks, invest in education and workforce development, and foster global collaborations to sustain their AI leadership. Their dedication to AI innovation places them at the vanguard of technology, shaping the future of AI-driven industries and applications.”\\n\\nDeveloping countries, on the other hand, are navigating the AI landscape with varying degrees of progress. The pursuit of AI remains challenging for these nations due to inadequate research infrastructure and funding constraints. Priorities centre on capacity building, fostering local talent, and seeking international collaborations—all crucial to materialising future socio-economic beneﬁts (38). Like the preceding frameworks, the methodology, evaluation criteria, and ﬁndings published in AI & Society are useful, tangible, and actionable for developing the Nigerian AI strategy.\\n\\n21.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n1.1.5. Risk Mitigation Strategies\\n\\n1.1.5.1. Tradeoffs\\n\\nAs noted previously, governments will ultimately have to make several tradeoffs to deﬁne AI policy at a national level. Some countries have started to explore them, recognising that the task is arduous given that businesses, individual consumers, and academics must work collectively to ascertain how these issues are managed. According to the domain theories and practice across nations, there are three primary AI trade-offs for consideration: innovation versus regulation, the individual versus the state, and transparency versus system vulnerability. In all cases, countries must determine how best to balance one side and the other. None of the trade-offs is mutually exclusive, and the right balance for each nation depends on various factors (39).\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nInnovation vs. regulation: An abundance of regulations or those that are too rigid hinder AI developers’ ability to introduce new AI solutions by excessively restricting the use of consumer data, for example, leading to improperly trained algorithms. Some policymakers, such as the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, are experimenting with new approaches like creating a regulatory sandbox. Canada, alternatively, is experimenting with AI superclusters to attract funding and talent and to transfer IP from academia to industry to accelerate innovation (39).\\n\\nIndividual vs. the state: There is a delicate balance between data privacy and the government’s need to access data to advance good or prevent harm. Cultural differences drive varying levels of consumer concern regarding data usage and privacy protections. The annual CEO Survey conducted by PwC found that respondents in Germany, the U.S., and the U.K. are open to government regulations on data collection. At the same time, those in China, India, and Japan favour fewer such limitations (40). Nigeria must deﬁne its unique approach to privacy matters, which should be ascertained via attitudinal research with citizens before embarking on policy development.\\n\\nTransparency vs. system vulnerability: Policymakers must also balance the need for people to trust AI systems by understanding how they work against the desire to protect the systems from attacks. Striking the appropriate balance on these variables will be heightened for industries where data privacy and integrity are paramount, such as banking and healthcare (40). AI and related technologies will indelibly transform every nation with far-reaching implications. Citizens and leaders across society would do well to express their views and get actively involved in helping their governments shape policies that will deﬁne humanity’s future.\\n\\n22.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n1.1.5.2. Mitigating AI Risks\\n\\nThe government plays a pivotal role in elevating equity and ethics and ensuring accurate outcomes in AI via technology policy. Mitigating the risks of artiﬁcial intelligence is essential to the technology’s positive impact on people’s rights and opportunities. Although there are myriad frameworks for assessing risk, and more will emerge ahead to address evolving needs as technology advances, the signiﬁcant factors to AI risk assessment are fourfold: accuracy, bias, transparency, and governance (41).\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nAccuracy: Any AI errors or erroneous predictions could result in injurious consequences to individual humans and/or humanity at large, necessitating system accuracy. Accuracy is associated with robustness and sensitivity, further complicating measuring an already complex variable. Additionally, there are trade-offs between bias and accuracy. Where each nation strikes the balance aligned with their particular country’s values and priorities will lead to several outcomes, including varying tolerance levels for bias.\\n\\nBias: When an AI system is biased, it is not representative of the larger population—a population that will experience the effects of the system’s output, like it or not. Bias is difficult to circumvent in a world built on biases. Societal biases bring bias to training data or may enter the system from the AI algorithms, for example. Criteria that drive protected characteristics (e.g., ethnicity) may be excluded from systems to mitigate bias. However, the action reduces system accuracy, thus requiring difficult tradeoffs.\\n\\nTransparency: The explainability of AI – or transparency – is the third prominent area of risk mitigation. Although a new trajectory of research in computer science, called explainable AI (XAI), has emerged, to date, most AI systems cannot explain the “how” to their “what”, leaving humans ill-equipped to understand the happenings from input to outcome. Among other issues, without transparency, assigning accountability for (inaccurate, harmful etc.) AI-generated decisions become challenging.\\n\\nGovernance: Governance processes are crucial to risk mitigation. There is a particular need for data governance, which is the fuel for AI systems. One best practice that is being leveraged today (borrowed from software development) is keeping prior copies of datasets to enable the reconstruction of past versions of applications if needed. Engaging diverse subject matter experts, testing, and monitoring are other best practices that serve as ongoing controls.\\n\\nAll of these activities are favourable steps forward toward better AI systems ahead. Moreover, taking cues from the efforts and guidelines for safety in ﬁelds such as transportation and healthcare – cross-disciplinary learning – is another solid foundational effort to move the needle forward about AI safety. However, anticipating the effects of emerging technologies has proven difficult, and AI is no exception. In addition to the preceding, robust testing and validation, ongoing monitoring and maintenance, human oversight and intervention, ethical considerations and compliance, regular auditing and documentation and engaging a range of disciplines and perspectives in strategy development and execution are the best tools available today to reduce the potential risks of AI systems (41).\\n\\n23.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nVision and Guiding Principles\\n\\n1.2.1.

Box: Data Storage, Compute and Research\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nThe current era of AI requires modern data centres with accelerated computing, data and model stacks. Consequently, Nigeria\\'s data centre infrastructure needs to be upgraded and scaled to meet the demands of AI research and use. Nigeria has one Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Robotics centre and 6 data centres operated by 5 entities (43). Nigeria has an AI infrastructure index of 42.67, according to Oxford Insight (33).\\n\\n1.4.3. Pillar 2: Building and Sustaining a World-class AI Ecosystem\\n\\nIn addition to infrastructure, Nigeria’s aspiration to be a global AI leader requires a robust and vibrant ecosystem. This pillar focuses on building that ecosystem of partners, collaborators, academia and a highly skilled workforce. Initiatives include training programs, industry-academia partnerships, and funding mechanisms to nurture a vibrant AI landscape. The pillar also positions the country as a key player on the global stage. International collaborations with leading research institutions and companies will fuel domestic AI development.\\n\\n1.4.3.1.

Box: Talent and Youth\\n\\nThe global demand for AI talents and skills is growing, and a highly skilled workforce is a critical long-term need of any well-functioning AI ecosystem. Frontrunner nations, regions, and companies have made and continue to make signiﬁcant efforts for many years to attract, develop, and train talent to build and use AI.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nThe issue of skills and talent in an ecosystem is monumental. It includes the education of future workforce on many levels, training the existing workforce, attracting and retaining talent to AI, and attracting international talent to Nigeria.\\n\\nNigeria shall also emphasise technical skills and talent to drive AI adoption and initiatives, as well as change management, interaction design, legal and business models, communication, innovation management, and many more context-dependent skills.\\n\\nNigeria aims to reduce unemployment by ﬁve percentage points by equipping at least 70% of Nigeria’s young workforce (16-35 years, including 50% of women and a good representation of people living with disabilities) with AI-related skills and knowledge. Nigeria shall also actively contribute to the local and global workforce, job creation and entrepreneurial endeavours in AI-driven industries.\\n\\nNigeria\\'s youthful population is one of its most signiﬁcant assets for promoting economic development, especially in AI. With a large youth population (44), Nigeria boasts a median age of about 18. Approximately 70% (44) of Nigerians are under 30, and 42% are younger than 15, positioning the country uniquely regarding potential human capital. According to the World Bank Report (45) on global demographic trends, between 2015 and 2035, 74% of the worldwide increase in youth aged 18–23 will occur in Nigeria and nine other countries. This demographic trend underscores the critical role that Nigeria’s youth will play in the global economy, especially in providing a digitally enabled workforce for the global AI ecosystem requirements.\\n\\nFurthermore, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) (46) forecasts that by 2030, 28 million jobs in Nigeria will demand digital skills, highlighting a market valued at $130 billion. This indicates a burgeoning opportunity for the country to leverage its youthful, tech-savvy labour force in driving economic transformation. Additionally, an Analyst Data Services and Resources report (47) notes that 75% of the Nigerian population is of working age, underscoring the urgency of creating conducive employment and skill development environments. However, despite these promising statistics, Nigeria needs help in realising the full potential of its youth demographic dividend. The country grapples with high levels of poverty, unemployment (48), and insecurity.\\n\\n31.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nThe shortage of skilled AI professionals poses a signiﬁcant hurdle and weakness to Nigeria’s ambition of becoming a frontrunner in African AI development. The limitation of adequate AI literacy and skilled labour must be addressed to harness and integrate AI potential to solve local problems in Nigeria. Following an interview by the president of Nigeria Computer Society (49), only 3% of IT professionals focus on AI and robotics. The educational infrastructure in Nigeria is not yet robust enough to support widespread AI education. Although there are initiatives to introduce AI curricula in schools, the implementation and reach are limited. Many institutions lack the resources to effectively teach AI-related courses, including technology and trained educators. In 2023, the Federal Government directed the Nigerian Educational Research and Development Council (NERDC) to ensure that robotics and artiﬁcial intelligence are integrated into the country’s primary education curriculum” (50). There is also the more signiﬁcant issue of brain drain (“the japa syndrome”). Nigeria is experiencing a considerable brain drain because of the high immigration of skilled professionals to seek better opportunities abroad. This outﬂow of talent deprives the country of valuable, talented people and exacerbates the talent shortage. According to a report by TechCabal (51), between 2014 and 2021, 474 Nigerian tech talent moved to the UK via the UK government’s Tech Talent Visa. The Tech Nation Visa report of 2021 states that Nigeria is the African Country with the most applicants for the UK Global Tech Talent Visa, ranking third in the world with 11.3% of applicants globally.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n1.4.3.3. Objective 2.3: Nurture a Culture of Innovation\\n\\nA vibrant innovation ecosystem is crucial for sustained AI advancement. This objective fosters a culture that encourages creativity, risk-taking, and continuous improvement.\\n\\nOutcomes •\\n\\nA ﬂourishing network of successful AI startups driving innovation and contributing to economic growth. Established AI Centers of Excellence, leading the development of industry-speciﬁc AI solutions, training the next generation of AI talent, and serving as ethical AI thought leaders. A well-established national AI conference that attracts international participation promotes knowledge exchange and stimulates innovation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n32.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nStrategies\\n\\n2.3.1 Establish Deep Tech AI Accelerators across Nigeria These accelerators will provide concentrated support and resources to high-potential AI startups, fostering research collaboration and accelerating commercialisation.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n2.3.2 Create AI Centres of Excellence These centres will focus on developing practical applications of AI in speciﬁc sectors, nurturing skilled individuals, and promoting ethical AI practices.\\n\\nAI Centres of Excellence (CoE) will ensure further localisation and application of AI solutions and mainstream AI knowledge across urban and rural areas. The CoEs will provide computing resources and technology infrastructure to support the experimentation of novel ideas that would lead to implementing localised solutions. This initiative will develop new innovative ideas that can be commercialised.\"\\n\\n2.3.3 Establish an accredited National AI Conference This annual conference will provide a platform for knowledge sharing, showcasing advancements, and fostering collaboration between academia and industry.\\n\\n1.4.3.3.1. Box: Thriving Startup Ecosystem\\n\\nNigeria has been seen as a fertile land for innovation, and this is evident in the country’s fast-growing technological ecosystem. Nigeria is among the “big four” African countries known for its innovation activity, startup funding, and globally acclaimed unicorns (52). Her reputation as the African technological powerhouse continues to soar, boasting the highest number of tech startups on the continent and showing no signs of deceleration. According to Statista, Nigeria witnessed a surge in startups, reaching over 3,360 in 2022. Most of these were established in 2019, accounting for approximately 15% of the total 481 ventures recorded in 2022 (53).\\n\\nThe global startup ecosystem report (54) of 2023 shows that Lagos held its place in the 50 - 60 range of emerging tech ecosystem rankings. Nigeria is undergoing an unprecedented tech revolution, creating fertile ground for emerging trends and remarkable opportunities.\\n\\nThe Nigerian tech landscape is experiencing remarkable growth, drawing interest from both local and global investors. Startups are increasing at an unprecedented pace, generating employment opportunities and bolstering the nation\\'s economic progress. Various subsectors collectively fuel the overarching surge observed in the ecosystem from 2015 to 2022.\\n\\n33.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n1.4.4. Pillar 3: Accelerating AI Adoption and Sector Transformation\\n\\nNigeria\\'s AI ambitions extend beyond building an ecosystem; it aims to harness this technology for real-world impact. Pillar 3 focuses on driving widespread AI adoption across various sectors, transforming industries and propelling economic growth.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n1.4.4.1.

Box: Strategic Government Initiatives for AI\\n\\nThe Government of Nigeria is committed to fostering innovation and entrepreneurship through initiatives like the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), which oversees IT development and regulation. Establishing innovation hubs and technology parks, such as Lion Science Park at the University of Nigeria and the Technology Park and Incubation Centre (Tech-PIC) at the Federal University of Technology Akure, highlights this commitment. Public service and policymakers are crucial in creating a conducive environment for AI growth in Nigeria. For instance, the House of Representatives Committee on Information and Cybercrime is developing and implementing AI policies, regulations, and frameworks that promote ethical standards, data privacy, and security. By encouraging AI use in public services, such as healthcare, education, and transportation, they aim to improve service delivery and foster public-private partnerships. These efforts ensure that AI development aligns with national goals and addresses societal challenges (55).\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n1.4.4.2. Objective 3.2: Drive Data-Driven Decision-Making\\n\\nHigh-quality data fuels AI. This objective emphasises leveraging data effectively to optimise decision-making across sectors.\\n\\nOutcomes\\n\\nConsistent and reliable data used in AI applications across sectors, leading to more\\n\\naccurate and trustworthy results.

Fostering collaboration between public and private sectors unlocks valuable data resources for AI development.\\n\\n35.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n1.4.4.2.1. Box: Access to Data\\n\\nAccess to quality data is fundamental to developing robust and reliable AI systems. Unfortunately, Nigeria faces signiﬁcant challenges with data across collection, quality, availability, and accessibility. On data collection, a 2020 report by the World Bank titled \"Nigeria Digital Economy Diagnostic\" (22), revealed that Nigeria has a low data collection rate. This implies a need for more data in various sectors, hindering the development of AI models that could address critical issues in signiﬁcant sectors. Additionally, the quality of available data is another crucial issue. Many datasets in Nigeria suffer from inaccuracies, incompleteness, and a lack of standardisation. This data quality needs to be improved to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of AI algorithms, which require clean and accurate data to function optimally. Even when data is available, they must be more cohesive and consistent. Different sectors and organisations maintain their data repositories with varying standards and formats. The lack of a uniﬁed data system makes gathering comprehensive datasets necessary for robust AI training challenging.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n1.4.4.3. Objective 3.3: Cultivate an AI-Ready Workforce\\n\\nA skilled workforce is essential for successful AI adoption. This objective focuses on developing a talent pipeline with the necessary knowledge and skills.\\n\\nOutcomes • • •\\n\\nIncreased number of individuals with AI skills across various sectors within ﬁve years. Increased number of scholars producing AI-related intellectual contributions.

These programmes will identify, nurture, and develop talent from diverse backgrounds, ensuring an inclusive AI workforce.\\n\\n3.3.2 Develop a National AI Research and Development (R&D) Fund In support of cutting-edge research and attracting global talent, create an AI Research and Development Fund (AI-R&D Fund) to facilitate the research and development of AI in Nigeria.\\n\\n36.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n3.3.3 Develop a National Research and Education Network (NREN) Build a high-speed, reliable network for research institutions and educational facilities to enable seamless collaboration and data sharing within the AI community.\\n\\n1.4.4.3.1. Box: AI and Jobs\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nJob displacement, bias, and privacy are among the top ethical and social concerns associated with artiﬁcial intelligence, posing signiﬁcant threats to its development in Nigeria. According to the World Economic Forum Report, the global job market is expected to see a net reduction of 14 million jobs over the next ﬁve years, with 83 million jobs projected to be lost and 69 million created (56). While new roles, such as data analysts, scientists, and AI and machine learning specialists, are emerging, this shift can exacerbate unemployment and social inequality in Nigeria, where the job market may need to adapt more quickly to absorb displaced workers. The fear of job losses can also fuel resistance to AI adoption, hindering technological advancement and economic growth. According to the Harvard Business Review (57), bias is inherent in all AI systems, as they make decisions based on training data that may include biased human decisions or reﬂect historical and social inequities. Even when sensitive variables like gender, race, or sexual orientation are removed, these biases can persist. This is a critical issue for Nigeria, where diverse cultural and social dynamics must be carefully considered to ensure that AI systems do not perpetuate existing inequalities or create new forms of discrimination.\\n\\n1.4.4.3.2. Box: AI Research and Development\\n\\nThe development and implementation of AI in Nigeria face signiﬁcant challenges, with funding constraints as a critical weakness. These ﬁnancial limitations manifest in several ways. For example, public investment in AI research and development could be much higher. According to a report by the World Bank (58), Nigeria spends only about 0.2% of its GDP on research and development, compared to the global average of 2.2%. While there is a growing interest in technology investments, private-sector funding for AI-speciﬁc projects remains sparse. The Global AI Index ranks Nigeria low due to its insufficient venture capital investments in AI startups compared to countries like South Africa and Kenya. The UNESCO Science Report 2021 (22) states that 80% of investment in Nigeria’s 101 tech hubs comes from offshore sources. The funding constraints also extend to educational institutions, which are crucial for nurturing future AI professionals. Nigerian universities often struggle with inadequate funding for advanced research facilities and AI-focused programs. The UNESCO Science Report 2021 (22) highlights that only a fraction of Nigerian universities offer AI-related courses, and those that do often lack the necessary resources.\\n\\n37.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n1.4.4.4. Objective 3.4: Achieve Widespread AI Integration Across Sectors\\n\\nThis objective focuses on promoting and integrating AI solutions across diverse industries, maximising its impact on the Nigerian economy and society.\\n\\nOutcomes •\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nA supportive regulatory framework for AI development and adoption, attracting investment and fostering innovation Increased collaboration between stakeholders, leading to the development and deployment of commercially viable AI solutions Increased awareness and understanding of AI among stakeholders, leading to accelerated adoption and problem-solving through AI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStrategies 3.4.1 Implement AI Policy Advocacy and Incentivise Research, Investment, and Adoption Creating an enabling policy environment that encourages investment and accelerates AI adoption, including green AI across sectors.\\n\\n3.4.2 Establish a tripartite AI Transfer Partnership Program This program will connect research institutions, businesses, and the government, facilitating knowledge and technology transfer.\\n\\n3.4.3 Organise annual AI Adoption Summits and Hackathons These events will bring together stakeholders to showcase AI advancements, foster collaboration, and identify innovative solutions.\\n\\n1.4.4.3.2. Box: AI Research and Development\\n\\nThe Government of Nigeria recognises ICT as a catalyst for developing critical sectors such as education, healthcare, agriculture, and manufacturing. The government is promoting partnerships between local ICT companies and foreign investors to diversify the economy from oil and gas. AI will drive innovation, increasing partnerships with both local and international companies.\\n\\n38.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n1.4.4.5.

This group of experts will guide the development and implementation of ethical AI principles in Nigeria.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n4.1.2 Develop National AI Ethical Principles This initiative will deﬁne the ethical principles that align with critical Nigerian values. These principles will represent the core values and standards shaping AI design, development, and deployment in Nigeria. Some suggestions of these principles include decoloniality, humanity, technical robustness and safety, inclusion, diversity, non-discrimination, accountability, solidarity, transparency, and responsible data governance.\\n\\n4.1.3 Develop a comprehensive AI ethics assessment framework This AI ethics assessment framework will provide a structured approach for evaluating the ethical implications of AI projects before deployment. The framework will evaluate the moral implications of AI technologies throughout their lifecycle. It provides a systematic approach for identifying, analysing, and addressing ethical considerations for designing, developing, deploying, and using AI systems.\\n\\n1.4.5.1.1. Box: AI Ethics\\n\\nBiased AI systems may also undermine public trust in technology, leading to decreased adoption and potential rejection of new technologies (59). This mistrust can have severe economic and social implications for Nigeria. If the public perceives AI as discriminatory rather than a means of advancement, the country may still need to realise the beneﬁts of AI fully. Such mistrust can even have far-reaching economic and social repercussions, as the promised beneﬁts of AI may remain unrealised if the technology is perceived as discriminatory or untrustworthy. This could result in missed opportunities for innovation and growth and exacerbated social tensions. Therefore, addressing ethical and social concerns is crucial for fostering a supportive environment for AI development in Nigeria.\\n\\n40.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n1.4.5.2. Objective 4.2: Shaping a Human-Centered AI Transition\\n\\nAI can disrupt society in various ways.

Box: Regulatory Acts and Initiatives Supporting an AI Ecosystem\\n\\nIn the dynamic landscape of technological advancement, Nigeria has embarked on a journey to foster innovation and embrace the transformative potential of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) with the call for developing the National Artiﬁcial Intelligence Policy (NAIP) as early as 2022 (60). Central to this endeavour are the regulatory acts and policies established by the government (61) to provide a conducive environment for the AI ecosystem\\'s growth (62). These include the National Policy on AI and Robotics, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Act (63), additional Acts on Data Protection Regulation, Cybercrime, the National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP), and the National Universities Commission (NUC). These regulations collectively address crucial aspects such as data protection, cybersecurity, technology transfer, and research, laying a foundation for robust AI innovation. One of the latest initiatives is the Three Million Technical Talent (3MTT) program by the Nigerian Government to train three million Nigerians in tech skills over the next four years. The program aims to enhance the digital economy and create digital jobs, positioning Nigeria as a net exporter of tech talent (64) (65). Through these concerted efforts, Nigeria aims to harness AI to drive economic growth, enhance public services, and tackle societal challenges.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n43.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR ATEGY 2 024\\n\\nImplementation Plan\\n\\n1.5.1.

AI Risks and Mitigation Strategies\\n\\n1.6.1.1. Introduction\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) is on the cusp of revolutionising business, governance, and the pursuit of social welfare, with transformative implications for education, healthcare, and the mitigation of pressing global challenges such as climate change, poverty, and hunger. Nevertheless, the rapid advancement of AI has generated concerns regarding its potential pitfalls, and rightly so, as the unintended consequences of emerging technologies are a historical inevitability. Therefore, developing national AI strategies must prioritise leveraging country-speciﬁc strengths and opportunities while concurrently and proactively addressing potential risks through thorough assessment, anticipation, and mitigation measures.\\n\\nThis is not an insigniﬁcant undertaking. Government leaders are confronted with a profound paradox as they strive to leverage AI at scale while simultaneously fulﬁlling their responsibility to safeguard citizens\\' interests and harness Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) for the greater good. This dichotomy necessitates a delicate balance between fostering innovation and exercising control over the far-reaching societal implications of emerging technologies. To enable their global clients to leverage AI for competitive advantage, PwC has identiﬁed crucial tradeoffs that governments must navigate in conjunction with businesses, consumer advocacy groups, and international organisations, in addition to articulating six critical risks associated with AI adoption at both the business and national levels (66).\\n\\nPwC characterises a grouping of risks as “National-Level,” these are risks that include economic risks (e.g., job displacement, loss of institutional knowledge), ethical risks (e.g., lack of values, goal misalignment), and societal risks (e.g., reputation, intelligence divide.) The National-Level risks are far-reaching and impact the socio-economic environment in which AI systems operate. These are issues that need to be resolved at the national, supranational, or societal level across the globe (66). Potential harms of poorly implemented AI systems, including misleading models, bias, and vulnerability to adversarial actors, are an additional risk area that has already manifested since generative AI made its mark on the global stage last year. Drivers behind substandard outcomes include the brittleness of current systems, making them easy to mislead and manipulate with variations in input, and shifts in dataset characteristics over time that threaten model reliability, thus leading to unintended consequences (67).\\n\\n45.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n1.6.1.2. Applying NIST Framework in Nigeria\\n\\nThe U.S. National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) Framework for AI Risk Management is a valuable tool for designing, developing, implementing, and using responsible AI systems while elevating reliability (68). The industry-neutral guideline provides a framework for measuring AI risks, optimising the beneﬁts of AI technologies and addressing their drawbacks by providing a systematic way to recognise, evaluate, and lessen the hazards related to AI systems. The NIST’s AI Risk Management System (RMF) deﬁnes a “trusted AI system” as possessing six characteristics: (1) validity and dependability, (2) security and resiliency, (3) improved privacy, (4) transparency and accountability, (5) interpretability and explicability and, (6) fairness, with zero negative biases. In addition to deﬁning the features of trustworthy AI systems, the RMF frames risks associated with AI. Together, the deﬁning and framing aspects of the RMF provide organisations and nations with a baseline understanding of how to evaluate an existing AI system or develop a new one according to the standards (69).\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nIn addition to providing a comprehensive overview of the attributes a trustworthy AI system should possess, the AI RMF provides four essential functions – Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage – that a nation can adopt to develop and deploy trustworthy AI systems across use cases and domains. The AI RMF Playbook facilitates the framework’s application, which offers detailed, actionable, and adaptive guidance to implement each of the four essential functions (Govern, Map, Measure, Manage) for trustworthy AI development (69). Notably, the NIST AI RMF is a working framework updated periodically with real-world results, applications, outcomes, and expanded expertise, leveraging the organisation’s vast network and resources. The NIST approach is a practical but ﬂuid systematic approach to accommodate emerging developments in AI and enable successful outcomes across diverse entities and systems.\\n\\nAccording to PwC, AI risks can be at the business or national levels. The National-Level risks are more critical and far-reaching and impact the socio-economic environment in which AI systems operate. These are issues that need to be tackled at the national, supranational, or societal level across the globe. They are categorised into economic, ethical and societal (66).\\n\\nSimilarly, KPMG surveyed executives across multiple sectors to determine their views of the risks associated with their AI (70). The risks identiﬁed were data integrity, statistical validity, model accuracy, transparency, fairness, resiliency and reliability (70).\\n\\nFurthermore, McKinsey has compiled a comprehensive catalogue highlighting the unintended consequences of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). According to McKinsey, adopting AI can lead to signiﬁcant and far-reaching unintended consequences, both maliciously intended and unintentional, affecting individuals, organisations, and society. These unintended consequences can have a profound impact, making it crucial to address and mitigate them proactively to ensure responsible AI integration and minimise potential harm (71).\\n\\n46.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nAccording to the World Economic Forum\\'s Global Risks Outlook Survey, Chief Risk Officers (CROs) from leading corporations and international organisations warn that Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) poses signiﬁcant risks if not properly understood and mitigated. They emphasise that AI has the potential to cause substantial harm if we fail to address the risks associated with its development and deployment (72). The NIST AI Risk Framework further highlights the potential harm related to AI systems, with an intentional emphasis on the harm to people (individual, group/community, and societal) (68).\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n1.6.1.2.

The approach combined preliminary research and a dedicated workshop to guide the process and ensure the development of a comprehensive, actionable AI strategy.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n1.8.1.1. Stakeholder Engagement\\n\\nA broad range of critical stakeholders in AI, including policymakers, industry experts, renowned researchers and startups of Nigerian descent, were identiﬁed. A four-day intensive National Artiﬁcial Intelligence Strategy Workshop brought together over 120 stakeholders from within and outside Nigeria to develop the Strategy. Using the previously identiﬁed pillars, eight working groups were formed, and the workshop focused on the following distinct stages:\\n\\n1.8.1.1.1.\\n\\nFigure 13: NAIS stakeholder workshop participation (Source: Compiled by authors)\\n\\n56.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\n1.8.1.2. Co-Creation Activities\\n\\nVision Development A national vision statement for AI in Nigeria was created through brainstorming sessions of the various sub-groups to determine the 2030 goal and priorities for Nigeria in AI and further review and harmonisation by the group. This vision outlines the aspirations for the role of AI in national development.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nGoals Setting Each working group focused on their speciﬁc pillar and deﬁned SMART goals aligned with the national vision.\\n\\nStrategic Initiative Development Each working group identiﬁed strategic initiatives to achieve their goals. They reﬁned the strategic initiatives by identifying dependencies, key stakeholders, resource requirements, timelines, beneﬁts and risks.\\n\\nRoadmap for Implementation A high-level roadmap for each pillar was developed, outlining timelines, key performance indicators (KPIs) for progress tracking, and process owners responsible for speciﬁc initiatives.\\n\\n1.8.1.3. Analytical Dimensions\\n\\nThe evaluation of the Strategy was conducted across seven analytical dimensions:\\n\\nStrategic Alignment the extent to which it aligns with the overall national development goals and priorities of Nigeria while clearly stating the role of AI in Nigeria\\'s future\\n\\nSocial the extent to which it assesses the social impacts of AI, both positive and negative, and identiﬁes measures to mitigate potential risks as it prioritises equitable access for all Nigerians irrespective of their background or location.\\n\\nEconomic the extent to which AI can be leveraged to drive economic growth in Nigeria and enhance Nigeria\\'s competitiveness in the global marketplace\\n\\nTechnological the extent to which it realistically assesses Nigeria\\'sNigeria\\'s current state of technological preparedness for AI adoption and the need for skilled human resources\\n\\n57.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nEthical and Legal the extent to which it addresses potential ethical concerns surrounding AI development and deployment and complies with legal and regulatory frameworks\\n\\nGovernance the extent to which a clear and effective governance framework exists for AI development and deployment.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nSustainability the extent to which it considers the long-term environmental and social sustainability implications of AI adoption\\n\\nThe diverse stakeholder group brought various perspectives to the determination of Nigeria\\'s priorities in AI and its goal for 2030, recognising that other nations have had a head start. However, one common factor that drove the discussions was the need for an AI strategy that considers Nigeria\\'s national context and reﬂects Africa\\'s dynamism, i.e., an AI strategy that looks at the development of AI for Africa while considering best practices.\\n\\nThe eight working groups of the workshop address the various analytical dimensions to ensure a holistic approach. Group 3 (Adoption and Sector Focus) ensures strategic alignment by prioritising AI development in sectors aligned with national goals. Several pillars address social and economic dimensions. Group 1 (Talent and Workforce Development) and Group 7 (Ethics and Social Impact) inﬂuence who beneﬁts from AI by fostering access to skills and ensuring fair development. Economic growth is driven by Group 3\\'s focus on speciﬁc sectors and Group 5\\'s (Infrastructure and Ecosystem) creation of a foundation for economic activity. Technological advancement is tackled by both Group 2 (Research and Innovation) and Pillar 5. The Ethical and Legal Dimension is a combined effort of Group 4 (Policy and Governance) establishing ethical frameworks, Group 7 addressing concerns like bias, and Group 8 (Safety and Regulation) deﬁning risk mitigation strategies. Finally, Group 4 establishes governance structures, and while there is no dedicated Sustainability pillar, Group 7 can be used to consider AI\\'s long-term social and environmental implications.\\n\\nRecognising the importance of synergy to avoid duplication of efforts and waste of resources, presentations were made by each sub-group at every distinctive stage to allow for feedback and comments on the practicality of the goals and initiatives and to identify areas of collaboration between the sub-groups.\\n\\nThe working group sessions fostered collaboration and ensured that the Strategy would reﬂect national priorities, industry expertise and ethical considerations, considering the need to close the gap between academia and the industry.\\n\\n58.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nSWOT Descriptors\\n\\nStrengths\\n\\nRationale\\n\\nA large and youthful talent pool\\n\\nNigeria\\'s population of over 200 million, with 75% in the working age bracket, represents a signiﬁcant talent pool for AI development and adoption. This young demographic is often tech-savvy and eager to learn new skills, providing a strong foundation for AI human capital development.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nStrong economic performance\\n\\nNigeria\\'s position as Africa\\'s largest economy, with a nominal GDP of $477.39 billion, signiﬁes a robust ﬁnancial base. This economic strength can translate into resources for investment in AI research, development, and infrastructure, fuelling the growth of the AI ecosystem.\\n\\nStrong regional inﬂuence and established diplomatic networks\\n\\nParticipation in global organisations like the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States allows for strategic partnerships on AI development with neighbouring countries, fostering knowledge sharing and potentially creating a larger market for AI solutions.\\n\\nVibrant private sector with access to capital\\n\\nNigeria boasts a thriving private sector, fostering a dynamic and competitive environment. This entrepreneurial spirit aligns well with AI development, where innovation and agility are crucial. The presence of a large stock exchange attracting domestic and international investors further strengthens this advantage. This readily available pool of capital can be a signiﬁcant advantage for funding AI startups and research initiatives.\\n\\nHigh youth literacy rate\\n\\nNigeria boasts a young population with a literacy rate of 75%. This creates a strong foundation for building an AI workforce. A literate youth population is more adaptable to learning new skills and concepts, including those related to AI development, data analysis, and machine learning. This translates to a readily available talent pool that can be trained and upskilled to support the growth of the AI ecosystem.\\n\\n59.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nThriving startup ecosystem\\n\\nNigeria boasts one of Africa\\'s largest startup ecosystems, according to The Global Startup Ecosystem Report 2023. This vibrant environment fosters innovation and risk-taking, which are essential for developing and deploying cutting-edge AI solutions. Lagos, a regional leader in ecosystem value and early-stage funding, with prominent deals like OPay\\'s $400 million Series C and Flutterwave\\'s $250 million Series D, demonstrates the potential for attracting investment in AI ventures.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nEmerging tech hub\\n\\nLagos\\' ranking in the 51-60 range of the Emerging Ecosystems ranking showcases its potential as a hub for AI development. This ranking suggests existing infrastructure and talent that can be leveraged tobuild a strong foundation for AI initiatives.\\n\\nWeakness\\n\\nRationale\\n\\nHigh and unstable inﬂation\\n\\nNigeria\\'s current high inﬂation rate (26.72% in September 2023) creates signiﬁcant economic uncertainty. This discourages long-term investments, a crucial factor for developing a sustainable AI ecosystem. Investors become hesitant to commit resources to AI projects with potentially long payback periods due to the risk of inﬂation eroding returns.\\n\\nReduced consumer spending power\\n\\nAs inﬂation increases, the purchasing power of Nigerian citizens shrinks. This can lead to decreased demand for AI-powered products and services, hindering the potential market growth needed to support a thriving AI industry. Consumers may prioritise necessities over adopting new technologies.\\n\\nPotential for social unrest\\n\\nHigh inﬂation rates are often linked to increased poverty and crime rates. Social unrest can create an unstable environment that discourages investment in long-term projects like AI development, hindering the creation of a sustainable AI ecosystem.\\n\\n60.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nCurrency ﬂuctuation and exchange rate instability\\n\\nThe sharp depreciation of the Nigerian Naira against the US Dollar (over 70% in a year) creates signiﬁcant uncertainty for AI development. This makes it difficult for companies and researchers to accurately cost projects, secure funding, and manage international collaborations – all crucial aspects of a thriving AI ecosystem.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nLimited foreign exchange generation\\n\\nNigeria\\'s reliance on oil exports makes its foreign currency reserves vulnerable to ﬂuctuations in oil prices. A more diversiﬁed export base, particularly in technology-driven sectors, could generate a more stable ﬂow of foreign exchange, beneﬁting AI development by facilitating access to essential resources.\\n\\nUnstable and high energy costs\\n\\nFluctuating and high energy prices, particularly after the fuel subsidy removal in 2023, create uncertainty for businesses and individuals. This discourages investment in AI infrastructure and development, which often requires signiﬁcant computational resources. High operational costs due to expensive energy can make AI adoption less attractive for companies, hindering the growth of the AI ecosystem.\\n\\nLimited access to reliable power\\n\\nThe rising cost of energy is often coupled with unreliable power supply. This disrupts training and deployment of AI models, impacting their reliability 57 and performance. Frequent power outages hinder research and development efforts, slowing down progress in the ﬁeld.\\n\\nLimited investment in AI R&D\\n\\nNigeria\\'s growing public debt can constrain government funding for research institutions, universities, and initiatives critical for fostering domestic AI development. This limits the nation\\'s ability to compete in the global AI race and develop homegrown solutions.\\n\\n61.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR ATEGY 2 024\\n\\nFocus on debt servicing over innovation\\n\\nA large portion of government revenue might be directed towards servicing the national debt, leaving fewer resources available for investments in critical infrastructure upgrades that support AI development, such as high-speed internet and computing power.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nGovernance challenges\\n\\nNigeria\\'s performance in key global Governance Indicators falls below the average of selected comparator countries. This weak governance environment can hinder AI development by creating uncertainties for investors, hindering transparent data collection and use practices, and potentially stiﬂing innovation due to cumbersome regulations.\\n\\nEthical concerns and potential for bias in AI applications\\n\\nInsecurity can heighten societal tensions and increase the risk of bias creeping into AI algorithms used for security purposes, potentially exacerbating existing social issues.\\n\\nOpportunities\\n\\nRationale\\n\\nKnowledge sharing\\n\\nPartner with leading AI nations (e.g., China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative) to facilitate knowledge exchange through joint research projects, student exchange programs, and technology transfer agreements.\\n\\nFunding and investment\\n\\nCollaborate with development institutions (e.g., African Development Bank) and explore funding opportunities for AI research, infrastructure development, and startup incubation. This can accelerate the growth of a robust AI ecosystem.\\n\\nMarket access and standardisation\\n\\nRegional market access through continental and sub-regional trade agreements to establish clear regulations and standards for AI development and deployment. This can create a larger market for Nigerian AI solutions and foster cross-border collaboration. An example of such is the African Continental Free Trade Area\\n\\n62.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nAddressing global challenges\\n\\nPartner with international organisations (e.g., UN Sustainable Development Goals) to develop bespoke and nuanced AI solutions to address unique local problems with global consequences (e.g., poverty, climate, etc.)\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nLeveraging blockchain for secure AI systems\\n\\nThe Nigerian government\\'s recent National Blockchain Policy recognises the potential of blockchain technology in various industries. This presents an opportunity to explore how blockchain can be integrated with AI systems to enhance security, trust, and transparency in areas like data provenance, identity management, and access control for AI models.\\n\\nThreats\\n\\nRationale\\n\\nGeopolitical instability and disrupted supply chains\\n\\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine and the potential for similar conﬂicts in neighbouring West African countries create signiﬁcant uncertainty. This disrupts global supply chains for essential resources like hardware components and rare earth elements crucial for AI development and infrastructure. Rising food insecurity can lead to social unrest, potentially impacting the stability needed for sustained investment and innovation in AI.\\n\\nBrain drain and capital ﬂight\\n\\nWhile international migration can generate valuable remittance inﬂows, it presents a signiﬁcant challenge to Nigeria\\'s AI development. The mass exodus of skilled labour weakens the talent pool necessary for developing and deploying AI solutions. Furthermore, increased movement of capital can create challenges around regulation and ﬁnancial stability, potentially hindering investment in domestic AI initiatives in sectors such as: banking, IT, health, education etc.\\n\\nCybersecurity risks\\n\\nThe growing dependence on digital assets and the escalating nature of cyber threats emphasise the urgent need for strong cybersecurity measures to protect against potential threats in Nigeria\\'s rapidly changing digital landscape.\\n\\n63.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nResistance to AI due to feared Job loss/Bias\\n\\nWorkforce reduction and inherent bias due to AI uptake can pose resistance to adopting Artiﬁcial Intelligence. The result will be an increased unemployment rate and social inequality.\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n64.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nAppendices\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\n65.\\n\\nNATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIG EN CE STR AT EGY 2 024\\n\\nReferences and further reading\\n\\n1.
